### Goals/Features: 
- [x] Allow users to add new books.
- [x] Give them the ability to delete, edit, mark as read/unread accordingly.

### Learning Outcomes: 
- [] Improved DOM manipulation.
- [] Used prototype-based inheritance instead of classes.
- [] Fair usage of BootStrap.
- [] Implemented the design myself without cloning it from other similar projects.

### Future features:

- [ ] Mass delete books.
- [ ] Maximum of 20 books per page.
- [ ] Sort by and Filter books.
